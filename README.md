# Data
The main dataset (the *metadatabase*) is not stored in here due to size limitations and was uploaded to [Dryad](datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.pt80482) (DOI: 10. 5061/dryad.pt80482). You can also access an updated version of the dataset at CONABIO's *Infocéanos* web page (https://www.infoceanos.conabio.gob.mx). Any other data source can be found in the original article as suplemental material.

**NOTE**: The *metadatabase* is a dynamic dataset. The analysis presented in Palacios-Abrantes *et al* (2019) was done with the version stored at Dyerad under the DOI 10. 5061/dryad.pt80482.
